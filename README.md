# python_tip_calculator
A simple and practical Python script from Day 2 of the 100 Days of Code bootcamp. This calculator takes the bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people, then splits the total â€” making it easy to figure out who owes what. Great for practicing basic math operations, input handling, and formatting in Python.
