# ðŸ’° Python Tip Calculator

This is my **Day 2** project from the **100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp**!

The Tip Calculator is a simple Python script that helps you split a bill, including a tip, between multiple people. Itâ€™s a practical tool and a great early exercise in working with:

- Numbers and math operations
- User input and type conversion
- Variable naming and assignment
- Basic arithmetic logic
- String formatting and rounding

## ðŸ’¡ About This Project

This project takes in:

- The total bill amount
- The tip percentage you'd like to give (10, 12, or 15%)
- The number of people to split the bill

It then calculates how much each person should pay, including their share of the tip. The final amount is rounded to 2 decimal places for accuracy.
